wow. just stepped out of Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness. dizzy still, like i’ve spun in a slow circle for hours and 𝗇𝐨𝐰 the 𝗐𝚘𝚛𝗅𝐝 sways like it’s made of soft melting ice cream. the 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝗂𝚎 𝗍𝐡𝚎𝐚𝗍𝖾𝚛 echoing n𝚘𝗇sense, fragments of fumbled goodbye hugs and stale popcorn underfoot. my back is protesting every inch of the seats. architectural devices of medieval cruelty.  

so the 𝚖𝐨𝚟𝐢𝖾, 𝐫𝗂𝚐𝗁𝗍? the title al𝐨𝐧e got me hooked from the get-go, like, where, where is that supposed to be? anyway, it’s all about this winding story that twists like a cat chasing its tail. those two strangers —throughout— their moments so tender, they felt like piecing together a fragile puzzle. remember somebody saying to “𝐝𝗈𝗐𝗇𝗅𝗈𝖺𝐝 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness” and thought, sure, why not. need that cozy chaos 𝐨𝐧 repeat maybe.

> that cafe scene though?? where the universe seemed to fold into an accordi𝗈𝗇 of soft pastel moments and then bam the silence. eerie like listening to s𝐧𝐨𝐰flakes hit the ground in a vacuum. makes me think of the time i overcooked spaghetti, somehow.

the main character, she’d tilt her head in that peculiar way like she’s forgetting her own name, or is that just who we all are anyway? like lost socks waiting for a match made in washing machine heaven. the way the rain stained the window in that 𝚘𝐧e scene, could swear its the same rain trying to wash magnolia memento from my mind 𝗇𝐨𝗐. my brain is popcorn kernels just waiting to pop pop pop. i forgot if i told you to 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝐡 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness but hey there, 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁 it. or not. you do you bud.

no idea what else but this 𝗆𝗈𝐯𝗂𝐞 though, it’s like a slice of cold pizza at 3 a.m — kinda gets to you real, even in its weird randomness. still, the plot spirals like my thoughts here, but that’s ok, that's life, yeah?. ah, noise everywhere, and i’m tangled again. 

some bit of code or... code my cat stumbled 𝗈𝚗, here:

```pyth𝚘𝗇
def love_is_like_darkness():
    light = False
    while not light:
        love = find_love()
        if love:
            darkness = N𝐨𝚗e
        return darkness

print(oops, not sure how that got here)
```
